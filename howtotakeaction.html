    <h1>Renewable Energy</h1>
    <p>Examples of renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, bioenergy (organic matter burned as a fuel), and hydroelectric, including tidal energy. Renewable energy creates far lower emissions than burning fossil fuels.</p>

    <h1>Public Transportation </h1>
    <p>Public transportation gets people where they're going while emitting far fewer climate-warming greenhouse gases
      than private cars. Another reason is simple efficiency: while cars usually carry just one or two people at a time, a bus can carry 50 or more, and a train in a large city may carry thousands. </p>

    <h1>Recyling</h1>
    <p>An example of external recycling is the collection of old newspapers and magazines for repulping and their
      manufacture into new paper products. Recycling saves energy and prevents extraction of raw materials, helping to combat climate change.</p>
